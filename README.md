Overview
This case project, developed for the EY TechX Challenge, analyzed Nike’s digital ecosystem and brand reinvention strategy in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.  
Our consulting team, ACT Consulting Inc., proposed a bold, data-driven solution — “The Nike Hub” — an integrated digital platform combining personalization, community, and omnichannel commerce.

Process

1. Industry and Company Research:
   - Analyzed Nike’s 5-year revenue and stock performance to identify growth stagnation and brand fragmentation.  
   - Examined shifts in consumer loyalty, digital adoption, and competitor ecosystems (Adidas, Lululemon, Peloton, Crocs, Sephora, Starbucks, and Apple).  

2. Problem Identification:  
   - Disconnected app experiences (SNKRS, Run Club, Training Club).  
   - Declining DTC sales and loyalty retention rates.  
   - Brand identity dilution due to overemphasis on fashion vs. performance.

3. Strategic Recommendations:  
   1. Rebuild Consumer Connection – Personalize engagement with “Make Every Click Personal.”  
   2. Strengthen Digital Ecosystem – Introduce Nike+ 2.0, rewarding both workouts and purchases.  
   3. Enhance Omni-Channel Integration – Unified cart, AR try-on, live inventory visibility.  
   4. Refocus on Performance Heritage – Athlete-led campaigns reviving Nike’s sport-driven identity.  

4. Implementation Roadmap (18-Month Plan):  
   - Months 1–6: Develop and pilot the Nike Hub platform, begin AI model training.  
   - Months 7–12: Public launch with AR try-on, community features, and AI-driven supply chain forecasting.  
   - Months 13–18: Optimize algorithms, expand personalization, and scale experiential retail concepts.
